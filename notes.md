yeah I was just thinking for interaction, we can make it that pressing left
click or hitting space enters look mode. If you press space in look mode or
right click then you get a contextual menu where you can choose to shoot at them
or talk to them / whatever if you are close enough.
Look should use your previous direction to select where it's looking at at
first.
Then for inventory we have a button or pressing i, and when you select an item
you get a menu for whether you want to equip it or whatever. Similar things for 
character menu and equipment menu.
